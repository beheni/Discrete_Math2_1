# Tree Graphs
Algorithms on connected acyclic undirected graphs

## Comparison of Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms
The aim was to compare the time complexity of our implementation of two MST algorithms [Kruskal's](https://github.com/beheni/Discrete_Math2_1/blob/main/kruskal.py) and [Prim's](https://github.com/beheni/Discrete_Math2_1/blob/viktoria/prim.py)


## Experiment
We ran 10 iterations of each algorithm on graphs with 20, 50, 100, 200, 250, 500 and 700 vertices, of which we chose the minimum iteration time. Matplotlib is used for [visualisation](https://github.com/beheni/Discrete_Math2_1/blob/main/data_for_visualisation.py)
